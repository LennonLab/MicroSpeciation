# How does speciation rate estimated from exponential model and 10^12 compare to
# speciation rates estimate from the literature?
# Define a speciation event based on time it takes for 16S gene with length 1600 bp
# to accumulate enough substitutions so gene is 3% divergent.
# Number of substitutions needed is 1600 * 0.03 = 48
# Kuo and Ochman (2009) report substitution rates of 0.4 - 1.5 per million yrs.
# Corresponding times to divergence are 32 (48/1.5) to 120 (48/0.4) million yr.
# With speciation rates of 0.008 (1/120) to 0.0313 (1/32) per million yr.
# Lower range is very close to estimates from the exponetial model = 0.007 per million yr.
# With low speciation estimate, plugged into exponential model = 7.8 * 10^13
